# Parser
 
This code is designed to get a formula as text and convert it to a form that can be made for calculations. It supports "+", "-", "/", "*" and
power calculations. Moreover, it is possible to give variables inside it as a Map.

Reading plain text files and detecting formulas with variables will be handled for future developments.
